# A collection of linux commands that I like to have access to on the Window's cmd terminal.


## To use these batch scripts in the command terminal the location of the file that contains them must first be added to the users' path environmental variables:

1)	open start menu and search for "edit environment variables for your account"
1)	navigate to and open the editing window for the "Path" variable
1)	click "New" and enter the full path to the batch scripts folder
	- ie:	"C:\Aliases"

> [!Note]
> User must log out and log back in in order to load the new environmental variable before any command terminal can use them.
